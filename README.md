# PARALLELIZED-IMAGE-CRAWLING-USING-MULTITHREADING

## ABSTRACT ##
In this project, I design a parallel web crawler by implementing multithreading concept. Web crawlers are used by search engines for indexing of webpages. A web crawler bot is like someone who goes through all the books in a disorganized library and puts together a card catalogue so that anyone who visits the library can quickly and easily find the information they need. To help categorize and sort the library's books by topic, the organizer will read the title, summary, and some of the internal text of each book to figure out what it's about. The goal of our proposed bot is to crawl websites for images of a particular keyword and automating the download process for matching images. Multi-threading is used to speed up the crawling as the internet has a vast scope and it would be inefficient to use a single process to crawl the internet. The project will help in downloading images of keywords that can be given to the program and the web crawler will scrape google images for those particular keywords and download the images and place them in separate folders based on keywords. The downloaded images maybe used by the user as per their choice.
